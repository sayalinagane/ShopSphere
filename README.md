# ShopSphere
ShopSphere is a Django-based eCommerce web application that allows users to browse and shop for their favorite products. Users can view trending items, explore ongoing offers, and search for products by name or category (e.g., Clothes). Navigation through the homepage is open to all, but purchasing products requires user registration and login through a built-in authentication system (login, register, logout).

Once logged in, users can view detailed product information, add items to their cart, and manage their profile â€” including updating their username, password, first name, last name, and more. The cart allows users to review their selected items, remove unwanted products, view the total amount payable, and proceed to checkout.

The platform also includes a Support page where users can submit feedback or report issues via a contact form. ShopSphere is built using Django features such as models, forms, templates, and a structured app/project layout, providing a complete full-stack online shopping experience.

# How to Set Up and Run the Django Project

# 1 First, check if Python is installed on your system.
Open Command Prompt and type:
python
If Python opens the interactive shell, it means it's installed. Type exit() to exit the shell.

# 2 Create a new folder for your project and open Command Prompt inside that folder.
(You can do this by typing cmd in the folder path bar in File Explorer.)

# 3 Create a virtual environment for the project:
python -m venv foldername

python -m venv myenv (for better understanding keep myenv)

# 4 Activate the virtual environment:
myenv\Scripts\activate (for Windows)
or
source myenv/bin/activate (for macOS/Linux)

# 5 Install Django:
pip install django

# 6 To check if Django is installed successfully, use any of these commands:
pip list
or
